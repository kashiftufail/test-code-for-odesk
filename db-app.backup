Nonetheless, in the event that you are without the time to accumulate 25%, there are also what are known as &ldquo;high-ratio mortgages&rdquo; which permit down payments as low as 5%. For the safety of the mortgage provider, it is mandatory to obtain default insurance when commencing a high-ratio mortgage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the type of mortgage that is most appropriate for your situation, conventional or high-ratio, the more sizeable your down payment, <strong><u>the less you will pay in interest overall and the lower your monthly principal and interest payments will be</u></strong>, therefore saving yourself money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RSP Home Buyers&rsquo; Plan might be right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assist you with gathering funds for your down payment, the Retirement Savings Home Buyers&rsquo; Plan (HBP) allows you to borrow up to $20,000 from your RSP. You must mandatorily repay the amount borrowed within a tenure of 15 years, and the minimum required yearly payment is 1/15 of the amount borrowed. For example, if you borrow $12,000 from your RSP, you are required to pay back at least $800 per year until repaid. Note that failure to make the minimum payment results in the difference being added your taxable income for the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a more comprehensive overview of the RSP HBP, see this link: <u>Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Publication</u></p>\r\n	1	2013-10-25 06:00:39.969226	2013-10-25 06:01:37.097937	img_255.jpg	image/jpeg	10865	2013-10-25 06:01:36.349835	t	Save more in Long-run by Increasing Initial Down payment
3	<p>It was mentioned earlier that high-ratio mortgages allow you to acquire a mortgage to purchase a home with as little as 5% down. In order to make this possible the mortgage lender must be guaranteed some form of insurance in the event that you default on payments. This sort of insurance is referred to as CMHC or GEMICO and insures up to 95% of the purchase price of the home. There, however, are strict eligibility criteria necessary for qualifying for this insurance. Firstly, as the purchaser, you cannot use any more than 32% of your gross household income towards your mortgage payments, heating and property taxes.

4	<p>Surely in the short-run renting appears to be much cheaper than purchasing a home, however as research confirms, home owners on balance have a higher net worth than persons who rent. Intuitively, this is because the disciplined contributions to a mortgage cause home buyers to gradually add their home to the balance sheet as a sizeable asset. Contributing towards a mortgage guarantees that at the end of the day you have something you can call your own, whereas with renting, the benefits are just for the moment. To encourage homeownership the government affords tax breaks and benefits to Torontonians whom are acquiring a principal residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governmental incentives extended to Torontonians purchasing a home for the first-time make it an economical and attractive choice. For instance, <u>the federal government helps you save on closing expenses, and the provincial government helps you save on land transfer taxes</u>. Moreover, as aforementioned, you are able to borrow up to $20,000 from your RRSP via the Home Buyer&rsquo;s Plan to contribute to your mortgage down payment. See this section of the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking about the long-term is certainly a healthy habit. If it is your intention to live in a location longer than a few years it might make more sense to purchase a home. Would you really want to squander funds on an apartment or condo without any ownership title in the end? In the heart of Toronto, renting rates can run you easily into $18,000 (at a modest rental rate of $1,500 per month). In five years, you would have spent easily $90,000, without anything to call your own. Nonetheless, when buying a home, one must take into consideration the all the costs involved, from appraisal fees to home inspection costs, as well as the infamous Land Transfer Tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obtaining a home in Toronto can also be viewed as a sensible investment for resale in the future. Typically, the only time persons make little profit on such investments is when they try to sell the home in the near future (considered to be within three years of initial purchase), subject to the short-term ups and downs of the market. In the long-run, however, trends have shown that home prices have always increased, and so rather than &ldquo;dancing in and out of the market&rdquo; as Warren Buffet advises against (paraphrased), purchase your home and stick it out for the medium-to-long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is undeniable that real estate is one of the most secure long-term investments, hardly affected by depreciation, and known to appreciate in value. As a form of security, real estate can help you calmly settle into retirement with something of your own. Real estate may very well be one of the only vehicles that appreciate in value even when adjusting for inflation. It much better to have an appreciating asset than to have an increasing rental expense!</p>\r\n	1	2013-10-25 06:05:09.209172	2013-10-25 06:05:09.209172	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	Trying to decide if you should rent versus buy?
5	<p>The best real estate investments tend to be those that are sold extremely reasonably within an average or underdeveloped neighborhood that later transform into popular neighborhoods because of their appearance or proximity to venues of interest and usefulness. Essentially, the now coveted posh neighborhoods of Toronto where one finds the bright lights, big buildings and diverse food options, were once underdog neighborhoods waiting to bloom. It would be lovely to own property in such neighborhoods, but often prices are too exorbitant. The initial investors in these areas won big, and you can too, by looking for the following attributes when deciding on a location for your home:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1, Governmental and Corporate plans to invest, develop, or restore a neighborhood<br />\r\n2. Seasoned and old neighborhood whose buildings are being bought out and renovated, bring a new excitement to the area<br />\r\n3. Neighborhoods in proximity to public transit stations and near to downtown (within 30-45mins)<br />\r\n4. Quiet and safe neighborhoods known for the absence of crime (and or in proximity to a police station). See the Toronto Police website for a listing of neighborhoods and their crime ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The proximity of top-notch schools and hospitals. It is notable that the Fraser Institute does a review of schools on a yearly basis, and the results are available on the internet.</p>\r\n	1	2013-10-25 06:07:19.412762	2013-10-25 06:07:19.412762	gold-medallion-homes-single-family-community-daybreak-in-south-jordan-utah-picture-of-neighborhood.jpg	image/jpeg	358331	2013-10-25 06:07:18.545023	t	How to be first to identify a future leading neighborhood
6	<p>As of October 16<sup>th</sup> 2013 (Q3 2013), it was released by the GTA REALTORS&reg; that 5,307 condominium transactions were executed via the Toronto MLS system. Given that condominium sales of Q3 2013 stood at 4,498, Q3 2013 has achieved an 18% jump compared to last year&rsquo;s results. Within the City of Toronto alone the number of condominium transactions accounted for a sheer 72% of all transactions, an increase of 19.5% above previous sales rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The President of the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) explains these upward trends in condominium sales in the City of Toronto by noting that &ldquo;The Echo Generation wants to live close to where they work and play. It makes sense that they have turned to condominium apartments as they have moved into home ownership. Many condominium apartments in the GTA are characterized by their proximity to a diversity of employment, transportation and leisure alternatives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to changes in mortgage eligibility, President User continued by saying, &ldquo;A growing number of buyers have restarted their search for a condominium apartment since the summer. Despite the onset of stricter lending guidelines, buyers have found that home ownership remains affordable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Q3 2012 average selling prices for condos have risen by approximately 2% as of Q3 2013 &ndash; from approximately $333,846 to $340,069.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As described by the Senior Manager of Market Analysis at TREB, Jason Mercer: &ldquo;We experienced a moderate annual rate of increase in the average condo price. However, while condo sales were up, listings were down in the third quarter. If this trend continues, it could point to increased competition between condo buyers and an uptick in the pace of price growth moving forward,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	1	2013-10-25 06:08:08.441529	2013-10-25 06:08:08.441529	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	Condominium Rates and Sales Recover in Q3 of 2013
8	<p>It is sometime impractical to fix everything within your home altogether, however, the following five inexpensive enhancements will make a world of a difference to ambiance of your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. SPRING CLEANING AND QUICK REPAIRS &ndash; </strong>As is commonly perceived by the phrase &lsquo;spring cleaning&rsquo; this involves discarding any junk or unwanted items to unclutter the home, and giving everything a thorough cleaning. This would consist of wax shining you tiles, shampooing your carpets or steam cleaning them, wiping behind and beneath furniture and appliances, polishing wood work, shining windows and removing mold from grout or grime within bathroom. Simple fixes such replacing: blown light bulbs or broken light fixtures, missing window blind shades and torn window screens, will make a tremendous difference in the value and appearance of your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. THE POWER OF PAINT AND WALLPAPER &ndash; </strong>Few enhancements catapult the ambiance and value of a home as well as new paint job and or the application of wall paper. The right shades of paint will add new life and excitement to your home, so do research on the type of feel you are going for and choose the paint color that embodies that feel. Lighter colors tend to make spaces look much larger than darker shades. In the event that an area is really problematic, wall paper might be the practical solution. It looks impeccable and is easily applied, as fast in a single evening. Many home improvement shops sell affordable wall paper, especially true if the particular design your like will be discontinued or if the shop is on its last stock of it. A combination of wall paper and paint on different portions of a wall gives off a fancy and clean look as well. In addition to such a combination, it is wise to ensure that your new color scheme is coordinated with your appliances, your furniture, base boards and crown moldings. Nonetheless, fixtures and furniture can be painted as well to suit the new theme. If needed, inexpensive furniture pieces can be purchased and painted to be cohesive with the new ambiance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. RENEWING FIXTURES &amp; FURNITURE &ndash; </strong>Kitchen and bathroom fixtures such as faucets can be changed without much difficulty or expense. They will beautify the basin and room. For instance, you could implement Gooseneck metallic faucets, which are easier to use than older faucet styles. Furniture can also be enhanced by simply changing rusty knobs or knobs that no longer match the new color theme of a room. Knobs are also easily installed and affordable. In some cases a chair or coach may be too expensive to replace, so it might be more cost effective to invest in new upholstery to give it a &nbsp;&ldquo;like new&rdquo; look. New Ceiling fixtures such as fans and lights are also a great idea to compliment a room, and can be very affordable if you shop in the right places. Two final recommendations would be: coordinated carpets or rugs to add life to a room or even to cover a stain or scratch; and secondly, window treatments including drapes or new blinds to match the color theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. <strong>ART &amp; ACCESSORIES - Pictures</strong> express a thousand words with a single glance. They effortlessly liven their surroundings and a key component to completing a room. Scenic and artistic photos add emotion to a room and complete the feel. <strong>Mirrors </strong>also are quite useful in making a room look more spacious and more lit, and the beams reflect off the mirrors. <strong>Table Art and Figurines </strong>when placed in the right arrangements also bring life and design to an area, and can be purchased at affordable rates, <strong>Flowers </strong>also add much life, sweet scent and serenity to a room. A vase of roses or tulips can bring a sense of freshness to the environment for instance. Finally <strong>cushions </strong>have a special way of livening a room and sitting area, with its variety of shapes, textures and patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. CHANGE THE PURPOSE OF ROOM &ndash; </strong>Be open to the possibility of relabeling rooms and shifting their purposes. When doing so, it actually creates an entirely new feeling within the home. Perhaps the only fixed rooms are bathrooms and the kitchen as they have basins and bowls, but every other room in for the most part flexible. Your dining room and living room may swap locations, or your TV room and home office can also swap places. Think about the different possibilities of remodeling your home, simply by moving furniture around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TAKE CREDIT FOR ENGANCING YOU HOME!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enhancing your home can be effortless and affordable if you undergo the process yourself using your creativity and a few of the ideas found here. During the process you are bound to stumble upon a Eureka moment in which you see something easily implementable and value-added &ndash; trust your inner genius!

7	<p>A bathroom, while only a small part of home, if renovated actually carries major clout in terms of improving home sales prices. In fact, even very modest and inexpensive renovations to the naked eye appear to have been costly and painstaking. Follow these actions to improve your bathroom/restroom and increase the appraisal of your home:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ACTION 1 &ndash; LEAVE YOUR TUB OR SHOWER SPARKLING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a natural course of events a shower or tub tends to gather grime, mold or mildew due to frequent usage. In order to have your tub shine again use on the shelf cleaning agents or even try the effective homemade way of using lemon juice, fresh water and of course a scrubber to restore the sparkling image you want!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ACTION 2 &ndash; THE TOILET THRONE SHOULD ALSO SHINE!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appearance of a clean toilet is a reassuring signal to a home buyer whom would like to know that the house had been kept well. Seemingly ingrained marks and strains can be removed by the application of white vinegar. Apply the vinegar, letting it soak on the stains or discoloration which will be begin to be dissolved. Follow- up with a thorough scrub with the toilet brush and flushing. Vinegar can also be used to deodorize the toilet bowl by allowed three cups to settle within it for half an hour before flushing, and additionally, vinegar can also be used to clean the bathroom flooring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ACTION 3 &ndash; CLEAN THE FACE BASIN AND COUNTER TOP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To provide a sparkling face basin and counter top, blend lime juice with baking soda creating a strong paste. Scrub the basin and counter with the paste to remove any grime or soap scum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ACTION 4 &ndash; ENHANCEMENTS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At times, just adjusting one thing within your restroom makes all the difference. For instance, you might paint the walls a vibrant color to create a new feel, change old faucets or replace cracked and old flooring. It is not necessary to redo everything, however. Usually, focusing on the most obvious needed enhancement is most effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ACTION 5 &ndash; RENEW YOUR BATHROOM ACCESSORIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is astonishing how simply purchasing coordinated shower curtains, rugs and soap holders can enhance your bathroom value and improve buyer traction.

9	<p>When looking at trends it is apparent that housing sales are up 21% as of mid-October 2013 compared to their level during 2012. This represents a 13% jump over the typical average October sales in the last ten years (as noted by the TREB). Remarkable!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It seems clear that we have more than recovered from the temporary dip in residential transactions that resulted from the onset of stricter mortgage lending guidelines,&rdquo; which occurred during July 2013, harkened the President of TREB, Ms. Dianne Usher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, as of mid-October 2013, housing prices have risen 7.3 % and are averaged at $536,301. This is speculated to be as a consequence of the strong demand for low-rise homes outpacing the supply of these types of homes, noted TREB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The President of TREB, Usher, pointed to the stricter lending rules implemented within the Capital (Ottawa) during July 2012 and the GTA&rsquo;s land transfer taxes as the driving impetuses behind the decline in homeowner interest in upgrading to high-rise homes, and therefore in them listing their existing homes for sale. High-rise homes have become expensive because of these real estate regulation changes. Realtors observe that rather than spending additional monies on real estate fees and increased land transfer taxes, homeowners prefer to spend that money on renovations for their existing home. Simultaneous to the decline in housing listings, the demand for Toronto City homes nearby transit channels has spiked upwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to TREB results revealed Wednesday, the attempts of Ottawa to calm the Toronto housing market is trumped by the impact of the stricter mortgage rules, and the consequential catapulting of housing prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the beginning three quarters of this year (2013), the sheer quantity of condos rented via the MLS system has increased by 25% in comparison to this identical period last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demand continues to be aggressive for condo leases even though monthly rental prices continue to increase and in the face of a 21% increase in the quantity of condos listed this year compared to this very period during 2012 (Q1 - Q3).<strong>Canada&#39;s </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TREB noted that the number of single bedroom units leased via the MLS system has increased by approximately 30% as of the end of September 2013, and that monthly rental rate increased by 1.8% to approximately $1,633.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to two-bedroom units, demand had also increased by 20% as of the end of September 2013, and monthly rental rates had increased by 3.6% to approximately $2,173/month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest in three-bedroom units remain low with the number of leases increasing by just 3.6% and with monthly rental rates lower by approximately 2% and now averaging $2,610/month as of quarter three of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all rentals via the MLS system in excess of 80% were within Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	1	2013-10-25 06:14:17.898861	2013-10-25 06:14:17.898861	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	The GTA sustains a high rate of housing sales to match the undiminishing demand for condominiums, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board’s (TREB) mid-October results.
